# simple_ontology_matcher
This projects is the source code produced during my master thesis at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (which can be found [here](https://github.com/Pschroet/master-thesis-ps-ontology-matching)). It's an ontology matching tool, consisting of a backend, frontend and additional tools.

To run it, just use the settings.py as a Django application.
